# DonkeyKong
ABSTRACT
  
  Our project is bringing the popular 1981 Donkey Kong to modern VR! This exciting innovation will be a 3D version of the classic Mario game presented in 3rd person. It features characters such as Peach, Donkey Kong, and Mario as the user will play as Mario to save Peach from Donkey Kong. The VR transformation of this game will allow the users to feel like they are in the game with Mario as he jumps over barrels and climbs ladders.
